Hello! I'm a Software Engineer from Zaragoza (Spain) that loves Web Development, Data Mining and Business Intelligence.

I got my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2016 at University of Zaragoza. Nowadays, I'm actually working as full stack developer using .NET environment (Core and Framework) and Angular/Vue.js on top.

I'm constantly learning new languages and creating my own personal projects. Besides, I really enjoy attending tech events, sports and walking in the countryside. Take a look at my resume, my list of projects, my blog to know more about me.
